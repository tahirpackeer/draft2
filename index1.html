            The natural surroundings of Sri Lanka's turtle hatcheries have long
            been popular tourist destinations. You wouldn't want to miss the
            opportunity to participate in it. Every year, roughly 7000 young
            turtles are released back into the ocean in Sri Lanka, where about
            400 turtles lay eggs annually. In Sri Lanka, there are several
            turtle hatcheries that place a high priority on protecting the
            country's marine ecology.<br /><br /><br

            ><br />Turtle hatcheries are establishments and locations that care
            for turtles, shield their young from predators and other dangers,
            and make sure the turtle nests are kept and protected. </p2
          ><br />
          <p3
            ><br />Many turtle species are currently threatened with extinction
            or face the possibility of having their hatchlings sold by poachers,
            and they are also vulnerable to other external dangers. Since the
            hatchlings are released into the sea once they are strong and
            healthy, turtle hatcheries safeguard the safety of the turtles and
            their eggs.</p3
          ><br />
          <p4
            ><br />In Sri Lanka, hatcheries are typically found near beaches
            where sea turtles congregate to lay their eggs.</p4
          ><br />
          <p5
            >For educational and research purposes, they keep track of the
            number of hatchlings released into the water as well as the success
            rates of this. Tourists that visit these hatcheries are also given
            this information to help educate them.</p5

                  Turtles are among the world's oldest groups of reptiles,<br />
                  outliving snakes, crocodiles, and alligators!
                </li>
                <li>
                  An actual turtle cannot crawl out of its shell. It is
                  impossible <br />for them to get too big for the turtle since
                  its shell expands <br />along with them.

                  The dinosaur era, which lasted more than 200 million years
                  ago,<br />
                  is when these creatures first evolved.

                <li>
                  A turtle's shell actually functions as a component of its
                  skeleton, <br />much like your bones do. The turtle's spine
                  and rib cage are among<br />
                  its more than 50 bones.

                <li>
                  According to the IUCN, 129 of the 300 turtle and tortoise
                  species that<br />
                  are currently found on Earth are either endangered <br />or
                  severely threatened.

                <li>
                  Although many species live in or near water, turtles

                  air and lay their eggs on land.
